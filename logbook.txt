graph clustering

- cluster teams based on shot type, relate that to win percentage
total FGA & avg distance

- cluster teams based on heigh, relate that to win percentage
- cluster teams based on age, relate that to win percentage
- cluster

shot distance clustering with wins = inconclusive

8 clusters on paint x 3pointers, then average the wins for each cluster
. blue, with almost no midrange > low wins
. pink, with massive paint, equally low threes and midrange > low wins
. yellow and grey, with highest threes averages bellow blue, and paint between around 0.40 and 0.50 > mid tier wins
. magenta, with middle ground threes and low paint > mid tier wins
. red, more paint than magenta, meaning less midrange > high wins
. cyan and green, less threes than red and around the same paint > high wins

conclusion
. too many three attempts is a detriment to wins
. too much paint without threes is a detriment to wins
. ground between 0.25 and 0.30 threes + 0.45 and 0.50 paint contributes to the most wins, meaning midrange occupies around 0.20 and 0.30, the same as threes

do same, but count number of teams per cluster with 40+ wins (meaning they successful)
